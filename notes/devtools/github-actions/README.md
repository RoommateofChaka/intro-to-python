# GitHub Actions

We can use GitHub actions for continuous integration purposes, to run our automated tests and other automated checks.


## Configuration / Setup

We'll need to setup our repository with a config file at location ".github/workflows/python-app.yml".

From your repo's "Actions" tab, add an action called "Python application". Conclude the commit to add a config file (".github/workflows/python-app.yml") to the remote repo.

Pull the changes to update your local repo to include this config file as well, before proceeding.

For further customization of the config file, see these [examples](examples).
