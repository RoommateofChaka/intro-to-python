# Data Science "Freestyle" Project

This project provides students with an opportunity to collect and analyze a dataset to follow their own personal or professional interests.

Students can work on this project in groups of one, two, or three students total.

There are two phases to the project: Data Collection and Data Analysis. Each phase has its own set of deliverables.

## Phases

### Data Collection

Collect a dataset from the Internet. For full points, ideally collect your own custom dataset using either an API or a web scraping approach. It may be alternatively possible to obtain a dataset from Kaggle or an open data portal, but we will highly prefer to assemble our own dataset instead, to show off your programming abilities. 

Store the data in a datastore such as a CSV file or a database. Can use a local database or hosted solution like Google Sheets or Google BigQuery. You should be able to share access to your dataset with the professor, and with other students.

Create a Data Dictionary document describing the dataset you collected. The Data Dictionary should mention how the dataset was collected, and provide a URL pointing to the original source. The Data Dictionary should also include a list of each field or column in your dataset, along with the datatype and corresponding description of what that column means (and if there are any specific values, what they mean as well). The goal of the Data Dictionary is to allow another researcher to understand what the dataset is about and how to engage with it.

Deliver: your **Dataset** in CSV file or database format, as well as the corresponding **Data Dictionary** document in PDF format.

### Data Analysis

Perform exploratory analysis on the data. Create a Python notebook or code repository to analyze the data. It should produce charts, graphs, tables, and any other insights, as applicable, to tell a story about the data.

In your analysis, ideally include a statistical analysis component (e.g. correlation), as applicable. If you can perform some machine learning task (e.g. regression, classification, dimensionality reduction) on the data as well, as applicable, that will be ideal. Different datasets may be more or less suitable for different tasks, so feel free to consult with the professor about what types of analyses are most applicable for your specific dataset. 

Finally, package up your analysis results into a written report. It should tell a story about the data. Embed any applicable charts and graphs as produced by your Python code. 

Deliver: your **notebook document** in IPYNB format, as well as the **final written report** in PDF format.
